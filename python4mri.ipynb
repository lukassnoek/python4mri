    "This tutorial is about the programming language Python and how to use it for neuroimaging analysis. It is adapted from the first computer lab of the \"Neuroimaging: BOLD-MRI\" course given at the University of Amsterdam (Research Master Psychology). To run this notebook, make sure you have the following packages installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",
    "- nibabel\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll discuss \"Jupyter notebooks\" and how to use them. Then, we'll discuss some basic Python syntax and constructs; this should be doable for people who are comfortable with programming (e.g., from previous experience with other programming languages, like Matlab or R). If you're not comfortable with programming, or you notice during this tutorial that you get stuck often, we recommend working through the free [Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) up to and including unit 8 (loops). Note: you don't have to do the Codecademy quizzes (because you need to pay for that).\n",

    "So, what are Jupyter notebooks, actually? Basically, using Jupyter notebooks is like using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run Python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. Just like any editor, code in Jupyter notebooks is interpreted and executed by Python software on your computer/server.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two **modes**: edit mode and command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Command mode* is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin (as is the case now!): When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing **Esc** or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- *Edit mode* is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're reading and scrolling through the tutorials, you'll be in the command mode mostly. But once you have to program (or write) stuff yourself, you have to switch to edit mode. But we'll get to that. First, we'll explain something about the two types of cells: code cells and text cells."

    "\n",
    "Python is a multipurpose programming language, meaning it can be used for almost anything. While the \"standard library\" of Python (i.e., the functionality that is shipped with any Python installation) contains the bare minimum for any programming language, Python's versatility comes from a massive community of developers that created many different \"third-party\" packages for almost any purpose you can think of (e.g., visualization, machine learning, web frameworks, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) package provides functionality for scientific computing (e.g. statistics, signal processing);\n",
    "* the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) package provides data structures and functionality for (very fast) numeric computing (e.g. multidimensional numeric array computations, some linear algebra);\n",
    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",

    "As you can see, Numpy converted our original list (to_convert_to_numpy), which contained both integers and floats, to an array with only floats! You might think that such a data structure that only allows one single data type is not ideal. However, the very fact that it only contains a single data-type makes operations on numpy arrays extremely fast. For example, loops over numpy arrays are often way faster than loops over python lists. This is because, internally, Python has to check the data-type of each loop entry before doing something with that entry. Because numpy arrays one allow a single data-type, it only has to check for the entries' data type **once**. If you imagine looping over an array or list of length 100,000, you probably understand that the numpy loop is way faster.\n",

For example, here at the UvA, we have a Philips scanner and we often export our data as PAR/REC files. However, to streamline the development and use of neuroimaging software packages, the Neuroimaging InFormatics Technology Initiative came up with a new, standardized format, *nifti*, that most neuroimaging packages should support. As such, usually the first step in any (f)MRI preprocessing pipeline is to convert the scanner-specific files (e.g., PAR/RECs) to nifti. This is beyond the scope of this course, but if at one point you need to do this yourself, we highly recommed the [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) package!\n",

This file-format is supported by most neuroimaging software packages (such as FSL, which you'll use later in this course!). \n",

    "    Before handing in your notebooks, we recommend restarting your kernel (Kernel: Restart & Clear Ouput) and running all your cells again (manually, or by Cell: Run all). By running all your cells one by one (from \"top\" to \"bottom\" of the notebook), you may spot potential errors that are caused by accidentally overwriting your variables or running your cells out of order (e.g., defining the variable 'x' in cell 28 which you then use in cell 15). If you fix this before handing in your notebook, you prevent your ToDos from being graded as incorrect due to these unfortunate errors (because we grade your notebook from \"top\" to \"bottom\" as well).\n",
